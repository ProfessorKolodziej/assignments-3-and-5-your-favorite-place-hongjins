			History
		</h2>
		<p>
			Beijing's history is as rich and complex as China itself, spanning over three millennia. Originally known as
			Ji, the area that encompasses modern-day Beijing has been inhabited since the prehistoric era. The city's
			strategic location at the northern tip of the North China Plain made it a significant center for trade and
			governance.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most significant periods in Beijing's history came during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), when
			Emperor Yongle established it as the capital of the empire and began construction of the Forbidden City, the
			iconic imperial palace complex that remains a symbol of Chinese civilization today.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the 20th century, Beijing played a central role in China's modern history. It was the birthplace of the
			May Fourth Movement in 1919, a cultural and intellectual movement that advocated for modernization and
			reform. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Beijing became the political
			and cultural center of the nation once again, with landmarks such as Tiananmen Square and the Great Hall of
			the People symbolizing the new government's authority.
		</p>
		<p>
			In recent decades, Beijing has experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization, transforming into a
			bustling metropolis with modern infrastructure and a thriving economy. However, amidst the modern
			skyscrapers and bustling streets, traces of Beijing's ancient history and cultural heritage continue to
			endure, making it a fascinating destination for visitors from around the world.
